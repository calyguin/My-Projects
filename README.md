# my_projects
These are essentially my first projects I made with Python.


#csv_file_filter

There is a set of data on the values of real estate in the UK (it can be found by following the link: https://disk.yandex.ru/d/ZTnv3LiUeqEK5A, description of the columns: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-the-price-paid-data).

The script is creating a new .csv file containing all the real estate sold more than once.


#techsupport_script

This is a script for a techsupport employee based on PostgreSQL.

As you run it, you are able to pick one of the incoming requests and respond to it.

(To be able to work, it requires a proper database with incoming requests)
